project two in the course mathematical modeling

In this project we apply four methods to predict the population of North Korea based on the data given in the Internet.

First we want to use polynomial fitting. Thus we apply difference table to find the suitable order of the polynomial. The table shows alternative positive and negative in column 3, which force us to choose 2-order polynomial.

Second we apply logistic model and then fitting the coefficients

Third we apply interpolation

Finally we apply Grey prediction model. In this method, we perform a level comparison test on the known raw data in the first step. And then construct data matrix B and data vector Y in step two. Eventually, establish a model and solve for the generated and restored values. We can loop this operation, predict one stage at a time, and add the predicted value to the data for recursive analysis.
